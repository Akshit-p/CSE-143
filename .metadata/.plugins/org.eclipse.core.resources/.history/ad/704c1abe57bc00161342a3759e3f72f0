Group of Ten Udub hackers find a way to to get treasure of $100 Million.

The Hackers have a strict ranking in their group:
Founder is the lead Hacker(Hacker 1), co-founder is second-in-command (hacker 2), first recruit is the third most powerful pirate, and so on.
Based on this ranking, the hackers decide on a system to determine how to split up the treasure.
The lead hacker will propose a way to divy it up. Then all the hackers (including the lead hacker) will vote on that proposal.
If 50% or more of the hackers agree on the system, then that is how the treasure will be divied up.
However, if less than 50% of the hackers vote for the proposal, then the lead hackers profile will be revealed to the NSA.
The next-most powerful hacker will then become the lead hacker, and they'll restart the process.
This will keep going on until finally a proposal is agreed upon.
All of the hackers are very smart and greedy.
Each hacker will vote against a proposal if they know that they would end up with treasure if that proposal were to fail.
A hacker will also never vote for a proposal that gives him nothing.
You are the lead hacker now. You must come up with a proposal that will give you as much treasure as possible, without getting yourself exposed.
Keep in mind that the rest of the hackers all know that if your proposal fails,
then hacker 2 will succeed at coming up with a plan that benefits him the most while not getting him exposed.

What's your proposal?
